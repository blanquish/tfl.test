This program is a proof of concept to create my first mobile application using Android.

The aim of this program is to display the current status of each line of the London Underground, connecting to Transport For London API's and parsing the data received.

The result will be a colour coded list of tube line names with the current status of each one.

The application uses simpleframework to convert the XML received into objects.
